    "This script demonstrates SQL-based forecasting using Snowflake's Cortex ML functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Cortex ML?\n",
    "- SQL-native: No Python or coding required (but we'll use Python to execute SQL)\n",
    "- Fully managed: Snowflake handles model training and deployment\n",
    "- Quick setup: Simple SQL function calls\n",
    "- Best for: Analysts who prefer SQL, rapid prototyping\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Explore the HVAC demand data\n",
    "2. Prepare data for Cortex ML\n",
    "3. Train forecasting models using SQL\n",
    "4. Generate 1-year (52 week) forecasts\n",
    "5. Analyze results by region, product, and customer segment"
