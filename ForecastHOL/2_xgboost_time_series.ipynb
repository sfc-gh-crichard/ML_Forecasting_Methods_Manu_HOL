    "This script demonstrates custom ML forecasting using XGBoost with feature engineering.\n",

    "## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Add Required Packages First!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before running this notebook, you MUST add these packages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click **\"Packages\"** dropdown (top of this notebook)\n",
    "2. Search for and add:\n",
    "   - `xgboost` (version 1.7.3 or later)\n",
    "   - `scikit-learn` (version 1.2.2 or later)\n",
    "3. Click **\"Start\"** or restart the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without these packages, the notebook will use a basic statistical method instead of the XGBoost ML model!**\n",

    "## What is this approach?\n",
    "- Code-driven: Full Python control with XGBoost\n",
    "- Customizable: Feature engineering, model tuning, ensemble methods\n",
    "- Scalable: Leverages Snowflake's compute for training\n",
    "- Best for: Data scientists who need flexibility and control\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "1. Feature engineering (lags, rolling averages, seasonality)\n",
    "2. Train XGBoost models with Snowpark ML\n",
    "3. Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "4. Generate forecasts and store in Model Registry\n",
    "5. Compare with Cortex ML results"
