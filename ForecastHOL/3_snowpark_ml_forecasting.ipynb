    "## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Add Required Packages First!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before running this notebook, you MUST add these packages to use Snowpark ML:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click **\"Packages\"** dropdown (top of this notebook)\n",
    "2. Search for and add:\n",
    "   - `snowflake-ml-python` (version 1.0.12 or later) - **REQUIRED for Snowpark ML**\n",
    "   - `xgboost` (version 1.7.3 or later)\n",
    "   - `scikit-learn` (version 1.2.2 or later)\n",
    "3. Click **\"Start\"** or restart the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without `snowflake-ml-python`, the notebook will use a basic statistical method instead of the full Snowpark ML framework!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Add Packages in Snowflake:\n",
    "- In the notebook interface, look for **\"Packages\"** in the top toolbar\n",
    "- Click **\"+ Add packages\"** or the packages dropdown\n",
    "- Search for each package name\n",
    "- Click **\"+\"** or **\"Add\"** next to each one\n",

    "## What is Snowpark ML?\n",
    "- Integrated ML framework for end-to-end workflows in Snowflake\n",
    "- Python APIs for feature engineering, training, and inference\n",
    "- Model Registry for versioning and deployment\n",
    "- Preprocessing pipelines and transformers\n",
    "- Best for: Production ML workflows, scalable pipelines\n",
    "- **Recommended approach** for enterprise ML in Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "1. Use Snowpark ML preprocessing for feature transformations\n",
    "2. Train models using Snowpark ML modeling APIs\n",
    "3. Register models in Snowflake Model Registry\n",
    "4. Batch inference on new data\n",
    "5. Compare with other methods"
